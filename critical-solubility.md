# Critical IUPAC publication of solubility data

## Historical

The IUPAC's Solubility Data Series (SDS), begun in the mid-1970s, is an exhaustive compilation and critical evaluation of all the world's published results of experimental determinations of solubility. It is not concerned chiefly with the assessment of equilibrium constants. However, solubility products and other equilibria are discussed depending on the chemical system in question so we include it here for completeness.

Since 1979, over 70 SDS volumes have been published, including evaluated data on the solubility of gases in liquids, liquids in liquids, and solids in liquids. Since 1998, and following an agreement with NIST, the SDS compilations have been published four times a year in the Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data. Since January 2002, a Subcommittee on Solubility and Equilibrium Data of the IUPAC Analytical Chemistry Division has continued the coordination of the SDS-related projects.

## Scope

The IUPAC Solubility Data Project (SDP) has as its aim a comprehensive review of published data for solubilities of gases, liquids and solids in liquids or solids. A uniform format is followed for the assessment of all literature data sets. Where data from different sources agree sufficiently, recommended values are proposed. More information can be found at: https://srdata.nist.gov/solubility/intro.aspx. Table 2 lists all references of interest for the reader.

## Availability

The list of all solubility volumes is available at: https://srdata.nist.gov/solubility/IUPAC/iupac.aspx. Volumes 66-102 are available at the Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data and thus at a cost. The original volumes were scanned by NIST into PDF files and digitized. Table of Contents are provided for Volumes 20-40, providing a description of the organization of each of the volumes. These volumes are available in sections.
