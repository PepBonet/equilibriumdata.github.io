# Equilibrium data

A crucial part of any equilibrium modelling calculation is the selection of equilibrium constants that quantify the strength of interactions between metals and ligands. Locating suitable equilibrium constants that lead to reliable model results can be problematic. Numerous large compilations of equilibrium constant values have been published each having their own limitations, coverage and  availability. The persistence of existing compilations is problematic given that it is widely underappreciated how much ongoing work and effort are required just to maintain and distribute functional versions of computer databases. As a result, the access to existing compilations of equilibrium has become problematic 

Here, when possible, to plan to make available compilations which have become difficult to access.
