# Constants

Please find her constants from two different sources: European project COST, Working Group NECTAR, and IUPAC.

[WG1 - NECTAR](cost-nectar.html) for highly hydrolysable (HHC) and/or low-valence state (LVC) cations has prepareed a compilation of the hydrolysis constants of most elements of the periodic table. This work is related to its task of providing reliable, accurate and comprehensive sets of thermodynamic data of systems containing HHE and LVC.

You can find the result of the work in the following periodic table. By clicking in a given element, you can access a PDF file containing its hydrolysis constants at infinite dilution and T = 298.15 K gathered from the most relevant literature compilations (in green, recommended values).
