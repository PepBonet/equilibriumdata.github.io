# SC-Database

For many years, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) sponsored a non-critical compilation of metal complex equilibrium constants. The result was the publication of several volumes containing stability constants. In 1990, a computerised database containing the values from the IUPAC volumes was created by L. Pettit. The database – known as SC-Database – was distributed by Pettit's company Academic Software and was kept up to date with new values from the literature with the help of an extended team. The SC-Database was still being distributed by Academic Software until 2016–17 but is no longer available from any source. Due to the age of the software, users with copies of the SC-Database face difficulties getting the program to run on modern computers.

We will upload here the result of data queries for various chemical elements in pdf files.
