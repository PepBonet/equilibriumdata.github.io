# NECTAR metal hydrolysis constants

The Working Group “NECTAR for highly hydrolysable (HHC) cations” (WG1) of the COST Action 18202, Network for Equilibria and Chemical Thermodynamics Advanced Research, is compiling published critical values of metal hydrolysis constants.

By clicking on a given element, you can access a PDF file containing its hydrolysis constants at infinite dilution and T = 298.15 K gathered from the most relevant literature compilations (in green, recommended values).

This table is a mirror of the periodic table available at the <a href="https://www.cost-nectar.eu/pages/wg1_period.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COST action webpage</a>.
